# EventGhostJoinPlugin
an EventGhost plugin that exposes the Join for Android API, removing difficult set up

Simply copy the entire "JoinforAndroidAPI" directory into your EventGhost plugin directory, typically in:

C:\Program Files (x86)\EventGhost\plugins


From there, restart EventGhost and add the Join for Android API from the General Plugins menu after
clicking on the puzzle piece at the top. Then add your API key and devices+device IDs. 

Currently, only "Send Notification" is available. 

I am working on adding additional functionality, the most important being the ability to send to multiple
devices at once. Currently, multi-device messaging does not work as well as it should.
